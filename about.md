# about me
- I like mathematics, deep learning and images

- when I find time, I enjoy painting, biking on my busted fixie or hiking in any forest

- one of the maintainers of [AxonDeepSeg](https://axondeepseg.readthedocs.io/)

here, you will find thoughts about my research or article summaries to help me remember cool ideas
