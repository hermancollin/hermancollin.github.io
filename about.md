# about me
- I like DL, mathematics and images

- I cook, draw and train hard; the latter is to set a good role model for my neural nets

- currently a Master's student at [NeuroPoly](https://neuro.polymtl.ca/) and one of the maintainers of [AxonDeepSeg](https://axondeepseg.readthedocs.io/)

here you will find thoughts about my research or interesting stuff I read
