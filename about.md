# about me
- I make computers see neurons

- I love mathematics, deep learning and images

- when I find time, I enjoy drawing and hiking in any forest

- developer for [AxonDeepSeg](https://axondeepseg.readthedocs.io/)

- self-proclaimed free-thinker, why not

on this site, you will find thoughts about my research, posts about curious ideas and article summaries to help me remember cool stuff
