# about me

:new_moon:
- unreasonably passionate about DL, mathematics and images.
- I cook, draw and train hard to set a good role model for my neural nets
- currently a Master's student at [NeuroPoly](https://neuro.polymtl.ca/) and one of the maintainers of [AxonDeepSeg](https://axondeepseg.readthedocs.io/)
