## Jovialism?
First, let's talk about the humorous history behind the usage of this term by Québécois people.
French-Canadian philosopher André Moreau coined this term back in the 1970s when he founded the _Mouvement jovialiste_, 
a philosophical non-profit organization advocating for a strong, joyous, cultivated life. At its 
peak, the organization reached more than 3000 active members. It died down in the 1990s, but was brought 
back to life in the 2010s by Moreau's student, Nicolas Lehoux, with the creation of the "_Neo-Jovialist Movement_". 

The ideas pushed forward by this movement are ambitious and interesting. They consider the jovialist philosophical trend to 
be a great weapon against this "_New World Order_" that exploits performance and hyperconsumerism. They focus on the youth 
and want to fight academic disengagement (school dropout), bad parenting and suicide, by centering their thinking towards 
ethical values and community-centered principles, which they believe are desperately needed in our increasingly disconnected society.

But the jovialists were also weird and esoterical. For instance, when the non-profit org was initially registered,  
the lawyer, who was supposed to complete this simple task, slacked. On december 14, 1970, months after Moreau had initially 
filed this request, the non-profit was finally registered. Moreau, not the least bit preoccupied by this delay, saw this as 
much more than a coincidence: this date was actually the birthdate of Nostradamus, who "_had predicted jovialism 400 years prior_". 
Their website, [jovialiste.com/](https://jovialiste.com/), opens up to this rather mystical sentence: "_Attractions are proportional to destiny_". 
They advocated to "abolish politics", based on the idea that "humans can self-organize without the need for governments". 
In their ideal world, future societies would be governed by "scholar experts" who "represent the will of all without seeking to impose their own agenda". Of course, this is ridiculous because humans are fundamentally biased, and I think it sums up the weakness of this philosophy. Also, being one myself, I don't trust scholars with politics.

## Jovialism as a pejorative term
As a sidenote on Moreau, I found this interesting quote about him, which I'll roughly translate here:

> I understand that André Moreau's character can shock, and his ideas too. Moreau disturbs, exaggerate and sometimes appears ridiculous. He is our philosophical Dali.

The author of this quote, writer and translator Louis Gauthier, portrayed Moreau as a misunderstood genius. While public opinion may have unfairly judged him, Moreau is ultimately remembered as someone whose optimism exceeded reasonable bounds... and this characterization extended to Moreau's creation (the _jovialism_ neologism and his movement in general). Today, when someone mentions _jovialism_, it is generally pejorative and means "overexaggerated reality-denying optimism".   

## Optimism or Jovialism
Jovialism, in its pejorative sense, has quietly permeated our society—many people now exhibit this symptom without even realizing they've adopted such an approach. In particular, 
I think the tech industry is full of jovialists. And this is also the problem with smart people. Someone who is really smart can manipulate others, but more importantly can gaslight himself into believing the most absurd stories. I'm sure a lot of top FAANG engineers fully realized that they are _not_ improving society, because these are really smart people and smart people understand these things. However, they will happily gaslight themselves into thinking that their 7-figure high-level executive role at Amazon actually contributed to making the world a better place. This is the same thing as eating meat: I eat meat because it tastes good, but I also know that it's wrong. Most of us engage in this schizophrenic paradigm to buy meat originating from mass breeding, because deep down we all know that these industries are nightmarish hellscapes. However, when you start denying reality, you open the door to jovialism, and everything around you becomes hearts and butterflies!
